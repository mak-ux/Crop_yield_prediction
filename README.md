## Explanation of files.
1. Linear_regression_model.ipynb 
File is the code file for multiple linear
regression model with accuracy 25% (very less accuracy because data is
time series data).

## 2.Linear_regression_model2.ipynb 
File is the code file for multiple linear
regression model with accuracy 25% but with prediction result of each
individual data.(Predicting the sigle observation results).


## 3. tuned_regression_models.ipynb 
File is the code file for the
implimentation of different regression model to increase the accuracy ,in
which i have implimented the Linear regression(accuracy 25%),Linear
regression with L2 regularization(accuracy 25%),Polynomial
regression(accuracy 31%),Polynomial regression with
regularization(accuracy 31%),Random forest regression(accuracy
99.99),Nearest neighbor regression(accuracy 75%).
best model was observed on Random forest regression with accuracy
99.99%.


## 4.Prediction_statistics_with_Random_forest_regression.ipynb 
Is the code file for data visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn .In this program i
have visualised actual value and predicted value.

## 5.best_regression_model.pkl is the saved model for Random_forest_regression model.


## 6.multiple_regression_model.pkl is the saved model for simple multiple linear regression model.


## 7.data.csv is the data used for yield prediction.

## 8.crop_predict_app.py is python app which uses flask as a backend

## 9.templates directory contain the two html file (home.html and predict .html) which are used as a frotened with flask.


## 10.images directory contain the different images file which are obtained during result prediction.

## How to use code.

Run the file crop_predict_app.py after unzipping the zipped folder and
keep the files in the same folder as they are .
If you got the error while running the file ,please change the path of file in
the codes .
Thanks for reading
